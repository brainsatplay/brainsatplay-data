# brainsatplay-data

Generic data structures and organization tools for the brains@play ecosystem.
Trying to keep things cross compatible.

All mostly untested stuff, still re-integrating things across libraries

`npm i brainsatplay-data`

```
 import 'brainsatplay-data'

 DS.Struct(); 
 //DS.EEGStruct(...) etc.. 
 // The biosensing data formats are used in brainsatplay algorithms and frontend
 
 //DM  -- data manipulation mainly for EEG, DataTablet, DataThread (completely untested)

 //aaand read the code for the rest... for now...
```
